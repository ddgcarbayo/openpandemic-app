# Getting Started

First, create a fork of the [openpandemic-app](https://github.com/OpenPandemic/openpandemic-app) repo from master by hitting the `fork` button on the GitHub page.

Next, clone your fork onto your computer with this command (replacing YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

```git@github.com:openpandemic/openpandemic-app.git
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/openpandemic-app.git
```

Once cloning is complete, change directory to the repo.

```
cd openpandemic-app
```

# Set up the development environment

Run the following command.

```
npm install
```

This will download and install all packages needed.

# Steps

* In your fork, make the changes.
* If you've changed features, update the documentation.
* Make sure your code lints.
* Make the pull request!

 We recommend using an IDE or editor with an eslint plugin in order to streamline the development process. Plugins are available for all the popular editors. For more information see [ESLint Integrations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)
